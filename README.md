# Analysis of the Algorithms
This repository includes the implementation of sorting algorithms and matrix operations in Java. It also compares the time and space complexity of sorting algorithms and matrix multiplication algorithms.

# Comparison
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Merge Sort combined with Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Heap Sort
- Matrix Multiplication (Brute Force & Recursive)
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Maximum Subarray Problem (Brute Force & Recursive)
